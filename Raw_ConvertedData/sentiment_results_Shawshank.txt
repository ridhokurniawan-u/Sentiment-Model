Review: One of my favorite movies. It sucks you in every single time, though there is nothing nuanced about it—apparently the vast majority of imprisoned criminals are swell guys! But you can't deny it's charm, the superb performances, the lush score, etc. And it's the best bromance in the movies."},

Review: Easily, movie of the year. Brilliant storytelling from beginning to end. Not one bad scene. Plot twists and turns throughout the film. I loved that the storyline was unpredictable. Just when the audience thought the plot took a turn left, it went right, and vice versa. Great special effects. The perfect dose of Godzilla through the move. Godzilla-1 is an instant classic in every sense of the word. Make sure you watch (and listen) until the very end of the credits.'},

Review: "The Shawshank Redemption" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling, beautifully executed by director Frank Darabont and his stellar cast. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver memorable performances that grip you from beginning to end, deftly portraying a friendship that serves as the film\'s emotional core. The cinematography by Roger Deakins lends an atmospheric quality, capturing both the bleakness and the moments of transcendent hope that populate Shawshank Prison.\n\nWhat sets this film apart is its focus on the resilience of the human spirit, illustrated through its nuanced characters and their complex relationships. It\'s a film that respects its audience, allowing the story to unfold in a carefully paced manner that makes the emotional payoff all the more impactful. Every element, from Thomas Newman\'s evocative score to the meticulous set design, works in harmony to create a cinematic masterpiece that not only entertains but also enriches.\n\nTo put it succinctly, "The Shawshank Redemption" is more than just a movie; it\'s an experience that leaves an indelible impression. It stands as a paragon of filmmaking, a must-see that continues to resonate with audiences, both young and old even after nearly 30 years.\n\nOf all the films I\'ve seen in my life, this is the one I will watch and watch, and watch, over, and over again.  It is simply put; my greatest film of all time.'},

Review: Mesmo abordando personagens dentro de um contexto polêmico, "Um Sonho de Liberdade" é um dos melhores e mais emocionantes filmes já feitos. Sua estética é impressionante, assim como toda a construção narrativa dos personagens, principalmente de Red e Andy, que conseguem nos cativar a medida que a história avança, mesmo tendo em mente que eles foram capazes de cometer tais atrocidades. O filme mostra o lado humano, ele reforça quer todos estão ali para se tornarem melhores, uma nova chance de vida para aqueles que buscam sua redenção. A fotografia aliada a trilha sonora também é esplendorosa, a direção faz questão de nos manter vidrados através de suas geniais técnicas. Um destaque para Morgan Freeman, sua interpretação nesse filme é IMPECÁVEL.'},

Review: I think everybody should watch this film at least once in their life, I love morgan Freeman's narration. It shows us how life is for some people and it was so upsetting to see Andy being kept in prison and being innocent. The ending was amazing and although it made me cry seeing red leave the prison I dont know how it made me feel? I felt relieved but also sad for him because of how out of touch he was since he hasn't been outside them prison walls since he was a kid... but I also felt happy seeing him finally be free. I was so happy seeing Tim be free and living a quiet life. He was so optimistic and had a great outlook even though he was in prison for a crime he diddnt commit I was so glad he escaped. I love this film because it makes you feel so many different emotions through the film and at once! Great acting and storyline and DEFINITELY worth a watch"},

Review: A friendship with no interests involved, just surviving what circumstances have brought them, that is the bonding between Andy and Red. A story that highlights different aspects within the prison between the 40s and 70s, without leaving aside a reflexion about hope, freedom and imprisonment. I wanted to cry during the last 10 minutes of the film because the voice of Morgan Freeman was getting more and more emotional, mentioning details that I had not visualized from my reality.'},

The performances are quite good, the story itself is spectacular, and due to all these factors and more, this film manages to convey a great life lesson, the fact that hope is the last to die\nOne thing that is very crucial in the movie\' plot is the importance of having a great friendship, like the two main characters have.\nI end my review of the film with this beautiful quote by Andy Dufresne: "Get busy living, or get busy dying"\nThanks.'},

Review: One of the greatest movies I\'ve ever seen. Possibly the greatest of all. Such a profoundly moving and deeply beautiful classic. It feels so perfect. Everything about it, from Thomas Newman\'s superb score, which is also possibly one of the most beautiful pieces of music I\'ve ever heard; The Stoic Theme, to the characters and performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best, to the writing, of Stephen King at his best. \n\nThe writing is one of my favourite parts of the whole movie. Every line feels so profound, like perfect summations of deep human concepts. The whole story is so relatable to our own lives in many ways. The prison, as a metaphor for our own daily prisons we find ourselves in, whether it\'s our work routines or existence itself, feeling like a prison if we choose to view it that way, and the idea of breaking out of our prison\'s. Do we "get busy living or get busy dying"? Do we become institutionalised into our situations, and accept them, without torturing ourselves with dreams we know won\'t come true? Or do we allow ourselves to dream and hope and do we try to break out of our prisons? \n\nAlso the way the story is told is perfect, with the way information is revealed throughout the story, and makes for compelling second and third viewings. \n\nThis movie touches me so deeply. Andy Defresne\'s character is so relatable. The feeling of being innocent but then unjustly imprisoned, I feel like all of us feel a bit like that in life. Life is hard, yet I suspect all of us feel a little like it\'s not really meant to be this way, and we question, do we really deserve the struggles we find ourselves in? But the way Andy deals with his situation and his struggles is inspiring. Watching Andy deal with his ordeals breathes meaning and nobility into my own struggles. To see him fighting off attackers and bully\'s in prison, makes me less fearful of struggles in my own life. It makes me view my own struggles with meaning and heroism. \n\nSuch a perfect classic of a movie. One of the all time best. Perhaps the best of all.'},

Review: A fascinating story about the power of hope, and also what the absence of it can do to you. There is a life advice as well: to always be "busy living, not busy dying".'},

Review: To this point there's nothing i could say that would compare to this mindset of a man you'll think trapped by the circumstances of a false accusation, deprived of his own existence and forcefully barred against his own will, and one would even think as far as to say have no purpose as to the life he's been convicted to, more like there's nothing to live for, then a light in the dark came but the world around him was too cruel as to let it go, ladies and gentlemen boys and girls if you are reading this there's no better explanation to define the word HOPE than this, this is the light that will lead one to the conclusion that there's always a way and that's been my motto for as long as i can remember. it's like this I'll hope to get my wishes or hope to die trying, as long as there's hope fueling your every action in secret with an air of enigma, work till your hopes are realized, always remember one has to be flexible like Andy."},

Review: I do not know why this film gets so much hate. Yes, there are a lot of strange adjustments (or retcons) to the previous films (Who is this Lockwood guy? Claire's hand print significance? An erupting volcano?). Yes, the antagonists are predictable and their dialogue is bad. Yes, the pacing was a little off. All negative nitpicking aside, the film is a pretty solid entry in the Jurassic Park franchise.\n\nChris Pratt's Owen is a fantastic character and the relationship shown between him and the raptors (specifically Blue) brings out real emotion. I was entertained from start to finish and the concept of the ultra rich buying dinosaurs was intriguing. I would have liked more time on Isla Nublar and less time being chased by the Indo Raptor, but I was still happy with the finished product.\n\nAdditional opinion: The score while Claire and Owen are talking in the jail cell gave me full body chills."},

Review: I recently watched a good movie, which is called "Shawshank Redemption". The film tells the story of a banker named Andy who is persecuted for murder and innocent imprisonment and plans to escape from jail for twenty years successfully.  The main character Andy is a person who loves freedom and life, in his life in prison, he still couldn\'t get justice and he always gets excruciation from prison, but Andy was not destroyed by his experience and reality,  he is confident in life and his desire for freedom is even stronger than before, Shawshank is the name of that prison. The movie takes us through his journey in Shawshank and Andy uses his intelligence and resourcefulness to help himself, eventually leading to his redemption.\nFirstly, a thief was imprisoned for theft, he knew the truth about the deaths of Andy\'s wife and her lover, Andy excitedly approached the prison warden, however, the warden deceived him and ostensibly agreed to Andy and then secretly killed the thief because he wanted Andhy to stay in prison and assist him with his accounts. But after Andy learned the truth by himself, he bravely decided to gain freedom through his redemption!\n\tOverall, the movie also strikes a balance between its positive and negative qualities., Wwhile the film does not conceal the harsh realities of prison life, it can be able to find beauty in these situations and this story also inspired me never to give up easily and to be successful, to search for and pursue my dawn and future, simultaneously, also reminded people that anything is possible. In terms of criteria, this movie is based on its ability to tell a compelling story that can connect with the audience emotionally and intellectually, it is a superb masterpiece around the world. In conclusion, the "Shawshank Redemption" is an impressive movie, which guides us to maintain our passion for life.'},

Review: Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest movies made and shown during the 1990s that help the spirit of those people who have been victims of injustice. Tim Robbins as Andy portrayed his role perfectly as the prisoner who sought redemption on the crime he did not commit and outsmarted a rotten prison system. He was witnessed by Morgan Freeman (Red) who believed in his mission to freedom. This film is bold, inspiring, entertaining and easily a collector's gem."},
