Review: {'quotes': "A wonderfully wistful premise wasted on a movie that's a gargantuan glob of garbage. The movie is about limitless power, yet every character (especially Pegg's) consistently makes the most illogical, nonsensical decision possible, with no reasonable explanation as to why. Instead, director Jones (who displays no real directing touch) just tries to go for the easiest joke, and ironically the batting average for actual laughs is nearly nonexistent."},

Review: {'quotes': "This was ok for what it is.  I'm sure there are many things about it that could be better, but it's not really important to mention them.  Simon Pegg is enjoyable in it.  I frankly like the movie concept of someone having these kinds of unlimited superpowers, but I don't think this story was the best that could have been conceived considering the idea.  Nonetheless, it was worth my time to see it once.  The funniest parts of the movie were certainly Simon's dog voiced by Robin Williams.  There were many moments that made me laugh out loud and it was a pleasure to know that it was Robin Williams doing the voice.  I'm glad I watched.  I want the unlimited power Simon has in this movie and I'd immediately get to work on solving real problems.  Not a classic movie here, but enjoyable enough for me.   I don't think I'll watch it again."},

Review: {'quotes': "Ignore the snotty reviews. If you enjoyed things like Ant-Man, Deadpool or Meteor Man, you might enjoy this film. It's is a lot of silly fun, especially in the era of overly-serious comic book movies. Anybody who looks at this as a 'Monty Python Reunion' is mostly fooling themselves, even though it's great hearing their voices and seeing Jones onscreen for probably the last time. If nobody knew the Pythons were involved in this, the reviews would have been much better, but there's a lot of Python fans who only know the group's best material and judge everything against that, which is pointless and makes fun movies like this end up with 'rotten' score when it shouldn't. This is a fun, cute movie and anybody with a brain in their head should judge the film on its own merit instead of 'it's not as good as the best comedy ever made so give it one star'."},

Review: {'quotes': "Look, I think it should be said outright that the Monty Python crew produced two of my favorite comedic films of all time.  Those two films are Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Life of Brian.  The latter would, easily, be in my top 3 comedies of all time, along with Young Frankenstein and Black Dynamite.  In what order I would put them in is really irrelevant, it depends on my mood.  Regardless, Monty Python are considered comedy legends and for good reason, they've written some of the best comedy the world has ever seen.  The death of Graham Chapman, understandably, put the group to rest and reunions have been eagerly anticipated and, somewhat, delivered upon.  They did a series of stage shows in 2014 that were quite successful for the group.  Which brings us to this movie, which was, somewhat, promoted as a Python reunion.  The reason I start with this is the fact that I'm curious as to how many people actually consider this a Python reunion?  In my opinion, I wouldn't really call it that.  Yes, all the Pythons voice aliens in this movie, but it's not a real reunion because the movie is based off a script that Terry Jones and Gavin Scott wrote.  As far as I understand it, if my math doesn't fail me, Terry Jones is only ONE of the five remaining living members of the troupe.  Therefore, in spite of all being in the same movie, or voicing characters in the same movie at least, this does not qualify as a Python reunion.  I'd have to think that if all five members were involved in the writing of this film's script that this would have ended up being considerably better than it was.  This movie also has the unfortunate distinction of being the last movie Robin Williams completed before his death.  Conceptually speaking, this really is pretty much Bruce Almighty.  I mean, Neil is given the power to, literally, do absolutely anything, hence this film's very creative title, like Bruce was in Bruce Almighty.  Only difference is that the power in this flick is bestowed by aliens and not by Morgan Freeman, who IS God and he actually wasn't playing a character.  That's the only difference here.  Well, there is one other difference and it's a pretty big one.  Say what you will about Bruce Almighty, but that film at least had an actual structure and Bruce gaining his powers served some sort of purpose to its arc.  And, of course, I'm not saying that Bruce Almighty is the Breaking Bad of comedic films, but at least there was some rhyme and reason as to why everything was happening.  This movie, on the other hand, eh, not so much.  When I say that there's no real structure to this film, I really do mean that.  There's very little set-up before Neil ends up with the power to do anything he wants.  All he has is to say what he wants, wave his hand and it happens.  Say Neil wants a bunch of tits flying over his head, he can make it happen.  But you're given very little time to get used to the idea of Neil being sort of a loser who wants to get out of this rut that his life is currently on.  The entire conceit is so absurd, because the scene before he realizes he has the power, when his friend Ray asks him if he could have anything in the world, what would it be?  People don't really talk like that in real life, nobody just comes up and says that to you.  I mean, maybe they do, but not the way it was done in this movie.  It's just so obvious about its intentions, that it just lacked any sort of subtlety.  It just felt fake and that's the last thing you want to think while you're watching a movie.  You wanna immerse yourself in this world and these characters, but you are unable to do so with this movie when you have dialogue that's so obviously trying to play into the concept.  Perhaps that shouldn't be something to complain about, but I felt it was a negative in this movie.  But, to me, the biggest issue with this would have to be the fact that this is just a series of skits.  The movie is essentially Neil saying a bunch of random shit that would, hopefully, get a laugh out of you.  I did like Neil turning Ray's crush (who wants nothing to do with him) into a cult leader that worships Ray's every move.  That was actually really funny.  Perhaps it's not funny in every scene they are in, but just a funny idea in theory.  The characters are one-dimensional.  There's literally nothing to Neil other than him doing absolutely anything, here goes that phrase again, and not actually using his powers for good.  He uses them for selfish reasons.  And, really, that's the road the story should have gone down.  There's an interesting nugget of an idea here in exploring Neil's relationship with Catherine in that how can she know that he didn't set everything up perfectly so he could win her over.  But that is said the one time late in the film and is never brought up again.  And, fine, if you want this to be a straightforward comedy, with none of the 'moralizing' about using powers for good instead of selfish reasons, then you should have at least had some more consistent comedy.  I'd have to say that more than half of the jokes in this movie end up falling flat.  It just feels like it's a movie that's designed around the idea of trying to fit in as much random jokes as they possibly could.  Because they can do anything (sigh) that they want.  There's a scene where Grant, Catherine's possessive ex, makes Neil say that all pasty-white Englishmen have large ears and webbed feet.  Why?  I don't know, just because.  And, because Grant is a villain, he needs to be an asshole.  The editing is also very awkward.  Sometimes you'd be with the aliens (or Catherine and Rosie) and they'd just move on to the next scene without any real transitions.  They just throw you into it and it's a little jarring.  And not to mention that, again, a lot of these jokes fall flat and you're like 'was that it?'.  There's a few scenes with Catherine and Rosie that ends with them laughing because they probably know that it wasn't a good joke to begin with and they hope their laughter is somehow contagious.  It wasn't and it failed miserably.  The cast is enjoyable.  Simon Pegg is always likable and that doesn't change here, even if the movie fails him, Kate Beckinsale is always good and she ages like a fine wine and Robin Williams was a comedy legend.  But, as well-cast as this may be, and I mentioned this with Pegg, the script just fails them at every turn.  Which is a shame too because, despite the fact that there's not one original bone in this movie, I felt that this could have been an entertaining enough movie if a lot more work was put into the script.  Like a LOT more.  Like you need to go through several drafts, each one improving upon the last draft, for you to even get something that's even marginally entertaining.  There's a reason why people rarely ever film their first drafts as it is, because it'll probably suck.  And that's probably too harsh to say about this movie, I found it watchable and it does have its moments, but there's no denying that a lot more work needed to be put into this before it was ready to be shown off to the rest of the world.  It's obviously too late for that now, given that it's been a few years since this was released.  I don't know what else to say.  Can't say I'd recommend it, it just falls flat 65% of the time it tries something and the other 35% isn't good enough to make a real difference.  If you wanna watch something to honor the memory of Robin Williams, watch the Fisher King (ironically directed by Terry Gilliam, another Python member) instead.  And if you wanna celebrate Monty Python's legacy, Life of Brian and The Holy Grail are still in existence, there's nothing stopping you from watching those instead."},

Review: {'quotes': "'Absolutely Anything' is all in all a very mediocre film. It's not necessarily *bad*, but by no stretch of the imagination would I call it good. The first forty minutes of the film feel like an eternity as they throw exposition at you left and right. Hardly anything worthwhile. A few good laughs are had when Neil, the protagonist, first receives his powers, but it fades quickly.\n\nRobin Williams is usually an actor worth seeing a film for. But his voice work in 'Absolutely Anything' is downright unimpressive. Any former A-List actor could have voiced his character and done the job just as well.\n\nI quickly stopped watching once the romance started to develop. They try to avoid the whole consent issue halfway through the film, but the issue is Neil is more than willing to take advantage of someone he had no reason to believe wanted to have a physical relationship with him. And that's a little morally dubious.\n\nLike I said, I did not finish this movie. I had a few good laughs, but ultimately stopped a little more than halfway through out of overwhelming boredom. An amazing cast, director and writer, all culminating in a very below average film."},

Review: {'quotes': 'A Fantastical Comedy with Heart and Originality\n\nCritics have said that Terry Jones\' latest film is a disappointment, considering this is likely his last film.  I would say the real disappointment is that with the sun setting on Terry Jones\' career, the critics of our day are still as bloodthirsty, ruthless, and petty as they have always been and that he has to suffer for it. If you aren\'t aware, his mental condition is such that Jones no longer has the capacity for speech/communication; it\'s like a variation of Parkinson\'s - he is still in good physical health otherwise (John Cleese and Eric Idle have only recently made this public on their most recent tour together). Now I\'m not saying that because of Jones\' condition that they should take it easy on him; I\'m saying that they\'ve always been hypercritical and they fact that they are taking it out on a sick old man is just extra vile. Add to that what may now truly be Robin Williams\' swan[dog] song and the last reunion of the 5 living Pythons onscreen and we have ourselves a travesty - this film never had a chance to be welcomed as all the talents involved deserved. \nIt\'s not the most unique premise, to be certain - summing it up easiest would be "a secular Bruce Almighty". Jokes and gags are clever, cheeky, and kept me chuckling throughout. Honestly, I don\'t know how anyone could not laugh when Simon Pegg\'s wishes are hilariously misinterpreted.

Review: {'quotes': 'Decades after being launched into space, a space probe containing information about the human race and a map to earth is found by four aliens that make up the \'Galactic council\'. They debate on whether to destroy the earth or make humanity a member of the council, instead relying on \'Standard galactic protocol\' to decide. They will give one Human (Chosen at random) the ability to do absolutely anything they want. After ten days, if the powers have been used for good, the Aliens will spare earth and make humanity a member of the council. If the powers are used for evil, the earth will be destroyed for the moral improvement for the galaxy. The human is chosen and revealed to be Neil Clarke (Simon Pegg) a secondary school teacher who is both struggling with his jobsworth headmaster, Mr Robinson (Eddie Izzard) and with his lack of a girlfriend, although he has a crush on author agency employee, Catherine West (Kate Beckinsale), who lives underneath him in the apartment block. At first, oblivious to the powers he has, Neil accidentally causes an alien spaceship to destroy a classroom within the school, killing the entire class in the process. The galactic council scolds the alien that blew up the classroom, who responds by saying that out of the millions of species the council has evaluated, none have ever passed and have all been destroyed. Perplexed and anxious, Neil goes home and slowly realises he can do anything after causing his dog, Dennis\' waste to clean itself up, and causing spilt whisky to flow out of the drain and back into the bottle. He asks that "everyone who died come back to life" and unknowingly causes everyone who has ever died ever to be resurrected, resulting in a zombie apocalypse, he reverses this and asks that the explosion never happened, sending himself back in time to the previous day. He then confirms his suspicions by causing the PE teacher Miss Pringle (Emma Pierson) to worship his friend, Ray (Sanjeev Bhaskar) whereas before, she was repulsed by him. Over the coming days, Neil uses his power for personal gain by giving himself a more muscular body, increasing his penis size, making Mr Robinson be nice to him and giving Dennis the ability to speak (Voice of Robin Williams). With his newfound powers he can do anything, however he needs to be careful for what he wishes for...\n\nPeter Bradshaw, writing in The Guardian awarded the film 1/5 star, and said "cheap and cheerless sci-fi comedy. There\'s a blue-chip cast here, and it\'s directed by Terry Jones; the Pythons have cameos, as creepy alien creatures. But this low-budget Brit film is just depressing, a sub-Douglas Adams sci-fi comedy which looks like mediocre kids\' TV with a dismal script and cheap\'n\'cheerless production values. A huge amount of talent here. Sadly it goes nowhere." James Mottram, writing for The List, also awarded the film 1 star, and said "Simon Pegg and Kate Beckinsale head up an awful sci-fi comedy from Terry Jones. It\'d be very sad if this is the last Python collaboration to hit screens."\n\nAs the general reviews states, this is a pretty poor "sub-Douglas Adams" sci-fi comedy that has not much to offer despite a starstudded cast with the \nMonty Pythons, Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, Robin Willams etc. You´d think nothing could go pearshaped with all of them onboard, but sadly everything goes pearshaped. The plot is pretty ridiculous with some philosophical rant attached to it, the acting goes up and down, the comedy is pretty low in its humour, the CGI hardly up to scratch and everything feels so low budget which hardly helps the film. Yes, there are some scenes that actually works, but those ones are too few. And yes if you read between the lines there´s interesting topics such as moral, ethics, how to handle power, love etc, but it´s not handled in a very good nor entertaining way. And the whole ending is just cringe worthy. Nah, despite the fact that I do like Kate Beckinsale, the late and great Robin Willams and the Monty Pythons, "Absolutely Anything" just needs to be forgotten.'},

Was called "Bruce Almighty". Still, could\'ve been alright with that zany British humour on board, and no matter what Pegg is saddled with, he is an enjoyable screen presence. Yet the jokes miss, there\'s no riveting storyline - an achievement when aliens (a reunited Monty Python gang), a talking dog (Robin Williams\' final hurrah), and the end of days are involved.\n\nEdit the naughty adult bits out (which add absolutely nothing anyways), and go straight to kiddie video. Please.\n\n- hipCRANK'},

Review: {'quotes': '"Give me a really big d*ck! Ouch! Not "THAT" big! Obviously! Return to your old size! Let me have a d*ck that women find exciting! Yeah, that\'s better. Could I have it white?"\n\nWhat to expect from a comedy with lots of famous comedians ? They managed to persuade the full Monty Python crew to do the voices of aliens that form a kind of intergalactic council. The fact that Terry Jones sat in the producer\'s seat also helped, I guess. Simon Pegg plays the leading role as Neil. And you can hear the late Robin Williams in one of his latest achievements as the hyper-kinetic dog Dennis. Joanna Lumley and Rob Riggle were assigned respectively the most restrictive and the most annoying part. And finally Kate "Stonehearst Asylum" Beckinsale plays the part of the beautiful neighbor who\'s adored by Neil. What the hell can go wrong with such cast?\n\nIn many ways this film can be compared with "Bruce Almighty". Although the latter was superior in all areas. Even though I\'ve seen "Bruce Almighty" so many times, I can\'t resist watching it again every time I come across it while surfing the television channels. I\'m afraid I\'d skip "Absolutely anything" when I do. Just like Bruce, Neil got God-like powers at some point. So whatever he wishes, he can make possible just with a simple hand movement. However, this time it\'s not God who took care of that, but some belligerent space creatures from another galaxy. They plucked the Voyager, with an instruction tablet on it how to reach us, out of space. Initially earth would be destroyed. Eventually, this destruction is deferred and the humans are given the chance to prove that they are a superior race. And yes, our good friend Neil is the chosen one.\n\n"Absolutely anything" is the complete opposite of "The World\'s end" (another movie featuring Simon Pegg) in terms of development. "The World\'s End" first 15 minutes weren\'t particularly inviting. But as the film progressed, it became an amusing, hilarious film full of absurdities. "Absolutely anything" begins terribly funny with various comic and silly situations. But after a while the gimmick with the waving hand of Neil wasn\'t that funny anymore and from there on it all went downhill. Eventually it ends up as a trite, irritating and predictable slapstick. Even Robin Williams and the entire crew of Monty Python couldn\'t save it. Perhaps the hopping little turd at the beginning was a sign.\n\nThis may sound a bit too critical. It isn\'t all that bad. The extraterrestrial board has its funny moment (but don\'t expect Monty Python situations). The antics Neil has to undergo whenever he wishes something again, made me laugh regularly. The personal transformation, the classroom scene, the headmaster and the devotion to his colleague Ray, just to name a few. Strange though that Neil, as an English teacher, knows his grammar well when standing in front of the class, but when he\'s using his powers, the wisdom of the correct formulations is lost. Dennis the dog looks cute and cuddly and the improvisations of Robin Williams make it a personality. Hilarious sometimes. But it feels as if Williams worked within the lines of the script. Had they given him more improvisation space, it might have been funnier. And fortunately, the romantic theme wasn\'t developed extensively. All in all a relaxing and sometimes funny film. There are some lame jokes and an annoying American, but British humor and some absurd twists here and there, ease the pain. The most sad part of this film is the fact that it\'s the last film with Robin Williams starring in it.},

Review: {'quotes': 'Monty Python legend Terry Jones delivers something closer to the Farrelly Brothers and Adam Sandler than Python, and guess what - it\'s hilarious. Pegg works wonders, but you\'ll wish the concept had been pushed further, that there was more to the Pythons\' \'reunion\'. It\'s paced and styled like a children\'s film, with touches of Pythonesque nastiness that surface at odd moments. In the plus column there\'s a small handful of decent gags, a clutch of welcome cameos (Eddie Izzard, notably) and at 85 minutes it doesn\'t outstay its welcome. Sadly Robin Williams - in one of his final screen roles - does his best as the voice of Dennis the Dog, but despite some interesting revelations about tummy-tickling, the canine is severely lacking in one-liners, the performance a pale imitation of his wise-cracking work in Aladdin. It is a very silly, eccentric British film with comedy coy enough to suit the whole family and Python devotees who will see it out of duty. Absolutely Anything takes us on a fun ride through space and gives us a look at one simple man\'s struggle to do the right thing with infinite power. While it may not win any awards this season it will, at least, give you a few laughs. Absolutely Anything is a comic treat, especially for those of us who grew up with the Pythons. It\'s terrific to hear those unmistakable voices again.\n\nVERDICT: "High-Quality Stuff" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD.

Review: {'quotes': "Absolutely Nuts\n\nA group of aliens decide to put the fate of the world in the hands of one random guy by giving him the power to make anything happen as a test towards predicting the values of humanity.\n\nBritish writer/director Terry Jones, known for his work with the hilarious Monty Python comedy group, returns with his first feature film in 19 years for Absolutely Anything, and it's absolutely perfect absurdity. From a hilarious talking dog to a series of unpredictable gags ranging from walking turds to the accidental annihilation of an entire classroom of kids, the film's unpredictable humor is completely nuts. But like a fine mix of chocolate-covered nuts, Jones makes sure none of the jokes ever become mean-spirited, ensuring the film maintains some refined substance through its mostly lighthearted antics. Just don't expect the same style of humor seen in his '70s comedic masterpiece Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nNow I won't try and bring your hopes up with empty promises, considering this flick is far from being award-worthy. Any forms of deep character development or profound script elements are instead replaced with an extra dose of silly gags, but at least they're funny enough to justify their existence. Full of unexpected wit that cleverly mixes its comedic styles, Absolutely Anything had me laughing from start to finish. Obviously Simon Pegg deserves some recognition for this, considering he's the one that allowed the far-fetched situations come to life with impeccable comedic timing. The best parts are, of course, the trial and error associated with Pegg trying to figure out how to properly use his powers without having them hilariously backfire in his face. What will surprise audiences the most, however, is the fantastic voice work brought to Pegg's lovably annoying pet dog by none other than the late legend himself, Robin Williams. It's a little bittersweet considering it's his final roll, but it certainly comes with great pleasure to say it's a memorable one.\n\nThankfully I never bothered checking out the film's Rotten Tomatoes rating before watching it, because it's exceptionally low 8% critic approval might have persuaded me not to give it a chance. How the undeniably pointless Stan-Helsing or Kevin Smith's unfunny detective comedy Cop Out managed to get higher critic approval scores is beyond me. Maybe it's time people adjust the tracking on their VCRs and take the time to actually watch things clearly. Wait... People don't watch VHS tapes anymore? Oh... Well I guess we can't really blame the picture quality now can we? Hum... Perhaps my taste in movies has just relinquished in quality over the years? Or maybe my sense of humor just belongs in a Saturday morning cartoon? Either way, I'd like to think I'm not the crazy one."},

Review: {'quotes': "Review:\nThis movie is more silly than funny! For a comedy, I didn't laugh once through the whole movie and I found a lot of the scenes far fetched and badly written, which is surprising from Terry Jones. Its about a bunch of Aliens, voiced by Monty Python, who choose one random human to prove if they can understand the difference between good and evil. The Aliens give this human, which turns out to be Neil (Simon Pegg), the powers to do absolutely anything and if he chooses to do evil, the Aliens will eliminate earth. If he chooses to do good, the Aliens will welcome earth to the intergalactic community so it's up to Neil to save earth. Neil, whose a teacher for a disruptive class, soon realises that he has these powers but everything that he does with them, has catastrophic effects. He tries to help his friend at work, Ray (Sanjeev Bhaskar), by getting another teacher to worship him but she turns out to be psychopath. He also uses his powers to get a lady in his building, Catherine (Kate Beckinsale) to like him but her ex-boyfriend, Grant (Rob Riggle), visits her from America and he uses is soldier tactics to try and win her back. Neil then makes his dog Mojo, voiced by Robin Williams, able to talk and he fights of Grant, who attempts to fight Neil for Catherines love but when Grant finds out about his powers, he kidnaps Neil so he can get everything that he wants. Whilst holding a gun to Mojo's head, Neil reads through Grants list of demands and then Neil is saved by Catherine and Ray but the Aliens are not happy with what Neil done with his 10 days with ultimate power. The Aliens then decide to destroy earth but Neils last wish just happens to be the best one that he makes, ever since he received the powers. I really tried to find the amusing side to this movie but I just couldn't get into it. The Aliens were slightly funny, especially when they were speaking in there weird language but apart from that, I just couldn't see the point of the film. The things that Simon Pegg was doing with his unlimited powers, were really ridiculous and no one seemed that amazed about the whole ordeal. I know that you have to take this type of movie with a pinch of salt but when the humour isn't that funny, it's really hard to find anything good to say about the film. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis was Robin Williams last movie, which he voiced using Skype, so no one actually got to see him properly. His voiced isn't used in the movie that much, which is a shame because the dog is one of the best things in the film along with the weird looking Aliens. Anyway, this film was directed by Terry Jones, 73, who brought you the all time classics, the Holy Grail, Life of Brian and the Meaning of Life, which were all made with the Monty Python. He also supplied his voice as one of the Aliens and he wrote this movie alongside Gavin Scott so he really did give this movie his all. He was lucky to get Simon Pegg to play the lead because he has been quite busy making movies like Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Star Trek Beyond and Ice Age: Collision Course so this 45 year old has big things to come. As for this movie, I doubt that it will go down well with a big audience because of its warped type of humour. Personally, I think that a lot of the cast took on the project just to work with Terry Jones, not caring about the final outcome, so on that basis I'm not surprised that he got such a great cast. Anyway, Kate Beckinsale looked terrific and the dog was funny when it was talking but thats about it.\n\nBudget: N/A\nWorldwide Gross: $3.8million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/comedies starring Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, Rob Riggle, Eddie Izzard, Joanna Lumley and voices by Robin Williams, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Jones. 3/10"},

Review: {'quotes': "Little story about almighty power, when phrased correctly.\n\nThe absolute power of wish fulfillment has been connected to many beings, genie and god among others, but now even aliens can make one's wish come true. Absolutely Anything is a simple film blessed with nifty premise and charming charismatic lead in Simon Pegg. It's a light casual watch that surprisingly heartwarming and incredibly witty beyond the occasional quirky display, even though the premise doesn't have much depth. \n\nNeil (Simon Pegg) is an ordinary teacher who has been given ultimate power by a group of aliens for the purpose of judging the entire earth. The plot and cast are rather familiar, including the love interest by Kate Beckinsale along with the usual best friend and silly talking dog. It's pretty hard to fail on delivering a talking dog, especially voiced by Robin Williams.\n\nFirst and foremost, the humor is fun and fairly amusing. The script offers some ridiculous situations, often presenting these scenes for Simon Pegg to shine, and that he does. His character is utterly identifiable, wishing assortments of petty stuffs and ending up with stupid mistakes by simple poor choice of words. Some of these might feel overdone and the movie just goes for the boundary of safe route. \n\nPegg also seems like able to crate chemistry with the cast, and everyone is quite likeable, aside from a few over-the-top moments for a couple of them. The movie doesn't venture into deep thought about absolute power or the logic of bending reality, it merely a mild enjoyment with nice characters, most of whom work in platonic relationship. One extra credit for the presentation is how the visual looks sophisticated, it uses the scenery of England and the special effects fairly well.\n\nAbsolutely Anything is a much humbler film than the title suggests, it provides ample of light entertainment with a commendable performance by Simon Pegg even if the premise feels outdated towards the end. Plus, having Robin Williams again, even in doggy form is a nice treat."},

A very funny comedy with likeable and charming characters, hilarious situations they\'re put in and a story that could\'ve been handled better, but it\'s also good just the way it is. The movie\'s about a man, Neil Clarke, who is randomly selected to be the carrier of the power to do absolutely anything in the world. If he uses the power for good, the aliens won\'t destroy Earth, but if he uses it for bad purposes, then it gets blown up! The aliens are all voiced by the Monty Python team and they do a great job, although they\'re not given enough screen time and you could easily forget that they\'re even there. Simon Pegg is great in this film just as he is in many of his other films. His character is very likeable and funny. Robin Williams as the voice of Dennis the dog was okay. At times it felt like he was overacting a bit, but that\'s just what dogs do. I also have to mention Sanjeev Bhaskar who was really amusing as Roy. There are some truly hilarious scenes involving this character. The CGI was good, I\'m thankful they didn\'t go for the CGI dog thing (like in Scooby-Doo). The humour is almost constantly funny, though it gets a bit "we\'ve seen it before" near the end. Nevertheless, I had a lot of fun with this movie and I would recommend it to Simon Pegg and british comedy fans. As for those who\'re only watching it \'cause Monty Python team is in it, I think you might be dissapointed...'},

Review: {'quotes': "Le fait de revoir les Monty Python au cinéma, dirigés par Terry Jones himself, pouvait être assez encourageant. Avoir Simon Pegg et Rob Riggle au casting aussi. Pourtant, Absolutely Anything est une comédie inoffensive, clairement mal rythmée dans l'ensemble, jamais réellement originale mais furieusement drôle par moments, grâce à une créativité que l'on ne retrouve quand dans la première heure. A l'image de Bruce Tout-Puissant, c'est dans la deuxième partie que le film pêche, avec une volonté de résolution d'une intrigue absolument inintéressante. C'est dommage, car Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, Rob Riggle et surtout Robin Williams font le boulot. Mais on est clairement en présence d'un film qui a près de 20 ans de retard."},

Review: {'quotes': "This was a movie that I thought had a lot of comedic possibility (even if the story t did sound a bit like Bruce Almighty) and with a guy like Terry Jones as the writer and director of it, I was intrigued. However, it turns out to be a pretty dull story, the script is not that well-written,  the characters are dull and bland, the designs of the aliens are hideous, and it's a movie that didn't have as many jokes as I hoped, it didn't take advantage of the opportunity's that it had with a story like this, and many of the jokes didn't turn out to hit the mark."},

Review: {'quotes': "Over the top but brilliant the whole way through from Simon Pegg's character Neil to Robin Williams' Dennis the Dog. Neil is given the chance by Aliens to save his planet by using the powers for good and if he uses them for evil its bye bye humans. The rest of the film builds on that premise by having Dennis the Dog talk who ended up being my favourite character of the film...a romance building between Neil and neighbour Catherine (Kate Beckinsale) and her crazy stalker Grant (Rob Riggle) who was one of the other great characters in this film. Also the voices of the Monty Python guys as the Aliens was awesome too. Critics were wrongly harsh on this film as it was a great piece of entertainment"},

Review: {'quotes': 'While I don\'t think it\'s "One of the worst movies ever made", or "appalling", as some critics have said. But I must say that I was really disappointed with Absolutely Anything, because I had such high hopes for this movie to be great just by the cast behind the movie and the director, but it didn\'t reach my expectations has I wanted. What\'s more sad is that this is the very last Robin Williams performance (He voices the dog in the movie).\n\nNot once did I laugh or even smile. It was very predictable and not that original when it comes to the story. Simon Pegg dose make a likable main character and Robin Williams dose a great job voicing the dog named "Dennis". But what\'s more crushing is that The Monty Python crew were involved in making this movie, because they wrote it, stared in it and one of them directed it.\n\nOverall Absolutely Anything isn\'t awful, but nowhere near great or good.'},

Review: {'quotes': "It's been a while since a film disappointed me this much. It has several genuinely funny gags, but it has almost no structure and is incredibly repetitive. When a film has Simon Pegg, Eddie Izzard, all 5 remaining members of Monty Python, and the voice of the late great Robin Williams, it should be a comedic masterwork. Instead, we get a movie that is often charming, but only occasionally funny."}]
